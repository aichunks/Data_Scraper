# Data_Scraper

## Youtube Scraper

Data scraping is a technique in which a computer program extracts data from human-readable output coming from another program.
Normally, data transfer between programs is accomplished using data structures suited for automated processing by computers, not people. Such interchange formats and protocols are typically rigidly structured, well-documented, easily parsed, and keep ambiguity to a minimum. Very often, these transmissions are not human-readable at all.

Thus, the key element that distinguishes data scraping from regular parsing is that the output being scraped is intended for display to an end-user, rather than as input to another program, and is therefore usually neither documented nor structured for convenient parsing.
